    Pipeline manages a single logical control flow (e.g., CPU thermal management)
    through Environment â†’ Controllers stages. It maintains named states that persist
    between executions and provides timing control for autonomous operation.
    
    Pipeline can operate in two ways:
    - Timing-driven: start() runs autonomous timing loop using persistent states
    - Process execution: execute() called by parent System, processes input states
    
    The same execute() method handles both cases - timing-driven mode calls it
    repeatedly on persistent states, process execution ignores persistent states.
