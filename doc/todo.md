## Overview

This document outlines the remaining implementation tasks for `aifand` following the completion of the base architecture and three-method pattern implementation.

### Tasks

1. **Implement Three-Method Pattern** (src/aifand/base/process.py):

   - Maintain backward compatibility for existing `_execute()` overrides

2. **Implement StatefulProcess** (src/aifand/base/stateful.py):
   - Extend Process with state management capabilities
   - Separate configuration (pydantic fields) from runtime state (instance attributes)
   - Override `initialize()` to set up runtime state from configuration

3. **Implement Buffer** (src/aifand/base/buffer.py):
   - Timestamped state storage with nanosecond precision
   - Methods: `store()`, `get_recent()`, `get_range()`, `prune_before()`
   - Efficient circular buffer implementation for memory management

4. **Implement FixedSpeedController** (src/aifand/controllers/fixed.py):
   - Demonstrate stateless pattern (override only `_think()`)

   - Validate first concrete example of three-method pattern

5. **Enhanced Permission Testing** (tests/unit/base/test_permissions.py):
   - Real Pipeline permission flow with FixedSpeedController
   - Hierarchical permission validation through System → Pipeline → Process
