# aifand Implementation Todo

## Overview

This document outlines the remaining implementation tasks for `aifand` following the completion of the base architecture refactoring.

---

## Base Architecture Testing (Phase 1)

### Objective
Implement comprehensive tests for the newly refactored base architecture to ensure all components work correctly in isolation and integration.

### Tasks

1. **Collection Protocol Testing** (tests/unit/base/test_collection.py):
   - **Protocol Compliance**: Test Pipeline and System both correctly implement Collection interface
   - **Storage Strategy Verification**: Pipeline uses list, System uses priority queue, both satisfy same behavioral contracts
   - **Edge Cases**: Empty collections, missing processes, duplicate names, type consistency
   - **Child Management**: count(), append(), remove(), has(), get() work correctly across implementations
   - **Timing Integration**: initialize_timing() propagates correctly to all children

2. **Pipeline Serial Coordination Testing** (tests/unit/base/test_pipeline.py):
   - **State Flow Validation**: input → child1.execute() → child2.execute() → output
   - **Execution Order**: Children execute in append order consistently
   - **Error Resilience**: Failed children don't break pipeline, execution continues
   - **Permission Integration**: PermissionErrors bubble up correctly
   - **Empty Pipeline**: Graceful handling with no children (passthrough behavior)
   - **List Storage**: Child management operations work correctly with internal list

3. **System Parallel Coordination Testing** (tests/unit/base/test_system.py):
   - **Priority Queue Mechanics**: Children execute in timing order based on get_next_execution_time()
   - **Independent Timing**: Children execute when individually ready, not synchronously
   - **Heap Management**: Processes correctly re-added to queue after execution with updated times
   - **Ready Detection**: _get_ready_children() accurately identifies processes ready to execute
   - **State Isolation**: Children execute with empty states {}, manage their own state
   - **Dynamic Timing**: Handles processes that change timing preferences during execution
   - **Simultaneous Execution**: Multiple processes ready at exactly same time

4. **Runner Hierarchy Testing** (tests/unit/base/test_runner.py):
   - **TimeSource Thread-Local Storage**: Thread isolation, basic operations, cleanup, concurrent runners
   - **StandardRunner Real-Time**: Lifecycle management, threading, timing respect, error resilience, graceful shutdown
   - **FastRunner Simulation**: Simulation time, run_for_duration(), deterministic execution, safety limits
   - **Time Source Integration**: Process.get_time() correctly uses runner-provided time sources
   - **Process Initialization**: initialize_timing() propagates through entire process tree

5. **Integration Testing** (tests/unit/base/test_integration.py):
   - **Runner + System**: StandardRunner executing System with multiple Pipelines at different intervals
   - **Runner + Pipeline**: FastRunner executing Pipeline with multiple processes
   - **Hierarchical Composition**: System containing Pipelines, System containing Systems
   - **Multi-Rate Coordination**: Complex timing scenarios (10ms, 30ms, 70ms intervals)
   - **Permission Integration**: Controllers/Environments work correctly under Runner execution
   - **State Flow Validation**: Data flows correctly through complex hierarchies

6. **Advanced Scenarios**:
   - **Concurrent Access**: Multiple StandardRunners in different threads
   - **Dynamic Modification**: Adding/removing children during execution
   - **Timing Edge Cases**: Zero intervals, very large intervals, timing changes mid-execution
   - **Memory Management**: No leaks from threading or thread-local storage
   - **Long-Duration Stability**: FastRunner reliability during extended simulations
