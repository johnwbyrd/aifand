# fanctl Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for `fanctl`, an adaptive thermal management system that operates as a standalone service and as a Python library. This plan is based on the principles and class structures defined in `doc/architecture.md`. The implementation is organized into phases, each building upon the previous phase.

The plan addresses multiple deployment scenarios:
- **Standalone daemon**: Running as a systemd service
- **Python library**: Installable module for integration with other projects
- **Package distribution**: .deb packaging

   - Establish clean import hierarchy and public API surface

2. **Configure Build System**:
   - Create `pyproject.toml` with metadata, dependencies, and build configuration
   - Define entry points for library usage and daemon execution
   - Set up development dependencies and testing framework

3. **Design Library API**:

## Success Criteria

Each phase includes completion criteria:
