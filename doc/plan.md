# aifand Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for `aifand`, an adaptive thermal management system that operates as a standalone service and as a Python library. This plan is based on the principles and class structures defined in `doc/architecture.md`. The implementation is organized into phases, each building upon the previous phase.

The plan implements the system as both a standalone daemon and as a Python package that can be imported by other projects. The architecture supports multiple network protocols for remote thermal management while maintaining a single source of truth through pydantic models.
